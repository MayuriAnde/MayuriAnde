Hi, I’m Mayuri 👋

Data Scientist | Machine Learning | Software Engineer

I turn complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My work focuses on predictive modeling, economic analysis, and building practical data science solutions that support better business and policy decisions.

About

I have around 10+ years of software development experience and data analyst. My recent interest with data science practitioner with experience in building end-to-end machine learning solutions — from problem framing and data preparation to modeling, validation, and clear communication of results. I focus on developing models that are interpretable, reproducible, and aligned with real-world decision-making.
